---- SUMMARY ----
Provides a method of defining user profile fields as "desirable." Desirable
fields are not required on signup but are nonetheless important, so users who
have not filled in said fields can be displayed to administrators in a list for
them to follow up.

---- REQUIREMENTS ----

* Entity API (entity) module

---- INSTALLATION ----

* Simply enable the module as usual.

---- CONFIGURATION ----

* For this module to be of use, you should configure some additional
  non-required fields on user profiles. These can be added under
  Configuration -> People -> Account settings -> Manage fields.

* To define fields as desirable, go to the module settings page under
  Configuration -> People -> Account settings -> Manage fields -> Desirable fields.
  
* A 'View users' field status' tab is provided for tracking the users.
